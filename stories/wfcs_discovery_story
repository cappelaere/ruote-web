Story: Anonymous access
	As an anonymous user
	I want to discover the WfCS Collections and MetaData
	So that I can see what is allowed and not see what is restricted
	
	Scenario: Discover the APP document link in headers of the home page
		Given anonymous user
		When user accesses '/'
		Then service document link is in the headers
		And service document link is valid
		And content-type is proper
		And collection links are valid

	Scenario: Discover the metadata for all collections
		Given anonymous user
		When user accesses '/wfcs/workflows.metadata'
		Then the status should be 200

		Given anonymous user
		When user accesses '/wfcs/definitions.metadata'
		Then the status should be 200

		Given anonymous user
		When user accesses '/wfcs/processes.metadata'
		Then the status should be 200

		
	Scenario: Discover the metadata for all collections using GData Syntax
